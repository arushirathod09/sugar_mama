	<h4>Welcome to Sugar Mama's Attic! We sell the best sugary treats in the world. Our choices and quantity may be limited, but we are super popular! Our company was established in 1970 by Mrs. Sweeny, also known as Sugar Mama. Mrs. Sweeny started making sweets in her attic because her stove stopped working, and she wanted something sweet to eat. Her attic was hot enough because she lived in Florida, and so it was the right temperature to boil the sugar, mix in the ingredients, and make the sweet treats. Mrs. Sweeney invented four sweets in her attic, they were called the Heart Lolli, Bubble Pop, Choco Drop, and Cotton Pop. Learn more about these sweets, what they are made out of, and how you can purchase these sweets down below! </h4>

		<h3>Heart Lolli</h3>
		<h2>These handmade treats come in the flavors of honey and strawberry. Heart Lollis are made out of sugar, light corn syrup, water, strawberries or honey, and a secret magical ingredient. To shape the Heart Lolli special handmade heart-shaped molds with a bite mark were created to pour the candy mixture in order to cool and harden into the unique heart shape. Each Heart Lolli is packaged individually in a pastel pink, thin cardboard box. Each Heart Lolli costs six dollars. Mrs. Sweeney invented these Heart Lollis by originally dipping strawberries into candy syrup and cutting out the strawberry into a heart shape mold that she created out of steel. She gave these sweets to her lover every day.</h2>

		<h3>Bubble Pop</h3>
		<h2>These handmade treats are bubblegum flavored and come in the colors pink and blue. Bubble Pops are made out of food-grade beeswax, powdered sugar, honey, peppermint extract, with a bit of sweet sap gum, and a secret magical ingredient. To shape the Bubble Pop, the mixture is rolled into a two-inch diameter sphere and is packaged into pink or blue parchment paper. Bubble Pops are packaged in a pastel green, thin cardboard box. Each Bubble Pop costs one dollar. Mrs. Sweeney invented these Bubble Pops by accessing the sweetgum sap in her backyard, letting it harden, and flavoring it with peppermint extract. She gave these sweets to the neighborhood kids every day.</h2>

To shape the Choco Drops, the mixture is cooled into one-inch circular molds. Choco Drops are packaged in a pastel blue, thin cardboard box. Each Choco Drop costs one dollar. Mrs. Sweeney invented these Choco Drops as she liked messing around with chocolate as she craved the sugary treat almost every day. There was never a week without a Choco Drop for Mrs. Sweeney.</h2>

These Cotton Pops were a hit with the neighborhood kids, and these Cotton Pops were specially ordered for every child's birthday.</h2>
